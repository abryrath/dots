#
##### directories ######
##
## Directory for storing ncmpcpp related files.  Changing it is useful if you
## want to store everything somewhere else and provide command line setting for
## alternative location to config file which defines that while launching
## ncmpcpp.
##
#
#ncmpcpp_directory = ~/.ncmpcpp
#
##
## Directory for storing downloaded lyrics. It defaults to ~/.lyrics since other
## MPD clients (eg. ncmpc) also use that location.
##
#
#lyrics_directory = ~/.lyrics
#
##### connection settings #####
#
mpd_host = localhost
#
mpd_port = 6600
#
mpd_connection_timeout = 5
#
## Needed for tag editor and file operations to work.
##
#mpd_music_dir = ~/music
#
#mpd_crossfade_time = 5
#
##### music visualizer #####
##
## Note: In order to make music visualizer work you'll need to use mpd fifo
## output, whose format parameter has to be set to 44100:16:1 for mono
## visualization or 44100:16:2 for stereo visualization. Example configuration
## (it has to be put into mpd.conf):
##
audio_output {
  type            "fifo"
  name            "Visualizer feed"
  path            "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
  format          "44100:16:2"
}
##
#
visualizer_fifo_path = /tmp/mpd.fifo
#
##
## Note: Below parameter is needed for ncmpcpp to determine which output
## provides data for visualizer and thus allow syncing between visualization and
## sound as currently there are some problems with it.
##
#
visualizer_output_name = Visualizer feed
#
##
## If you set format to 44100:16:2, make it 'yes'.
##
visualizer_in_stereo = yes
#
##
## Note: Below parameter defines how often ncmpcpp has to "synchronize"
## visualizer and audio outputs.  30 seconds is optimal value, but if you
## experience synchronization problems, set it to lower value.  Keep in mind
## that sane values start with >=10.
##
#
visualizer_sync_interval = 30
#
##
## Note: To enable spectrum frequency visualization you need to compile ncmpcpp
## with fftw3 support.
##
#
## Available values: spectrum, wave, wave_filled, ellipse.
##
visualizer_type = wave
#
visualizer_look = ●▮
#
#visualizer_color = blue, cyan, green, yellow, magenta, red
#
## Alternative subset of 256 colors for terminals that support it.
##
visualizer_color = 41, 83, 119, 155, 185, 215, 209, 203, 197, 161
